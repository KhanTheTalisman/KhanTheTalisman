**`A perspicacious Software Engineer & Entrepreneur`**

Hey! I'm Khan, I've been programming for the past 4 years, 
It has been a wonderful journey and an essential part of my life, 
feeding my curiosity and fueling my ambition to create incredible things.

For me, programming has been a fantastic journey. I was attracted by the unlimited possibilities within code from the minute I wrote my first **`hello world`** program.
I've had the good fortune to experiment with many programming languages, frameworks, and tools, which has allowed me to consistently broaden my skill set. 
I've improved my problem-solving skills, acquired an eye for detail, and built a strong analytical attitude as a result of my perfectionism.
